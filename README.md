# Yggdrasil for Android

The application for connecting to Yggdrasil network on Android 

Currently, the application has no options for changing configuration. It is currently in beta, and only has one button to connect and disconnect. More features are under development.

When the application first creates the network interface, the yggdrasil app will request for networking permissions. This only needs to be done once.

The app is running once a key is visable in the system dock. Disconnect by pressing the button again.

Once connected, you can access yggdrasil public services, as the application has peered automatically to default peers within the application.
